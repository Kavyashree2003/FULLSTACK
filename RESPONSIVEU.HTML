        <h1>ENDOMETRIOSIS</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Endometriosis is a medical condition that affects women of reproductive age, where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. Normally, the endometrium thickens during the menstrual cycle and sheds during menstruation. However, in endometriosis, the tissue outside the uterus also responds to hormonal changes, causing it to thicken, break down, and bleed during the menstrual cycle. This can lead to inflammation, scarring, and the formation of painful lesions or adhesions on nearby organs and tissues.
        <br>
            Symptoms of endometriosis may vary from mild to severe and can include:
            <br>
            1. Pelvic pain, often associated with menstrual periods.<br>
            2. Painful intercourse (dyspareunia).<br>
            3. Painful bowel movements or urination during menstruation.<br>
            4. Excessive menstrual bleeding.<br>
            5. Infertility or difficulty getting pregnant.<br>
            
            The exact cause of endometriosis is not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development, including genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalances, and retrograde menstruation (when menstrual blood flows backward into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body).
            <br>
            Diagnosis of endometriosis usually involves a combination of medical history, pelvic examination, and imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI. The only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis is through laparoscopy, a surgical procedure in which a small camera is inserted through a tiny incision to visualize the pelvic organs and confirm the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.
            <br>
            Treatment options for endometriosis aim to manage symptoms, reduce pain, and improve fertility. They may include:
            <br>
            1. Pain medications: Over-the-counter pain relievers or prescription medications to alleviate pain.
            <br>2. Hormonal therapies: Birth control pills, hormonal patches, or other medications to regulate hormone levels and reduce the growth of endometrial tissue.
            <br> 3. Surgery: Laparoscopic surgery to remove endometrial implants, adhesions, or cysts may be recommended for severe cases or infertility issues.
            <br>4. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART): In cases of infertility due to endometriosis, treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be used.
            
            <br> It's essential for women experiencing symptoms of endometriosis to seek medical evaluation and diagnosis by a healthcare professional. Early detection and proper management can help improve the quality of life for individuals with endometriosis.</p>
